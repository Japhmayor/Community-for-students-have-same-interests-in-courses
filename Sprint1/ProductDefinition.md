# Product Definition     
## Product Mission   
“Let students make friends while choosing courses easier”    
Explain:       
Firstly, based on the prerequisites and academic interests, our system can recommend potential students who have similar background and academic expectations, by which they are able to match automatically and have a chance to form a group in the same courses.Then we make a recommendation of the courses they might be interested in according to their former performances, such as the courses they have learned and researches they have done before.    

## Target User(s)     
BU students with similar interests and prerequisites on the same academic area, especially students who are in the same department or majors.    

## User Stories      
As a student who did not take this course before, I want to know the experiences from students who have taken the class I planned to choose, so that I can know more details about the class from students’ perspective.   
As a student user who is looking for professional advice, I would like to get some course recommendations based on my choices (interests, pre-courses I have taken), so that I can choose course wisly following their advice.    
As a student user who wants to find people have similar academic backgrounds and interests, I would like to find these people to have a place to chat with, so that I could make friends to prepare enough before the course.   
As an academic advertisement company, I want the data for what classes students like to take and their interests so that I can provide better services.     
As a student-organization or club, I would like to post our club information in the community of the targeted courses.     
As an academic program office of the college, I would like to know students’ interesting areas, so that I can open more courses on it.    
As a developer seeking for matching algorithm, I would like to know the principle of this matching system, so that I can adjust it to my needs.    

## MVP      
Most valuable product is providing a community for matched students.    
After we match students based on their own chosen labels (interesting areas, pre-courses had taken), we provide a forum for them to communicate with.    

## User Interface Design for main user story if required      
Most basic and most important: Forum community for students to share and communicate with.   
Webpage for people to choose their own “labels” (interests, pre-courses).
